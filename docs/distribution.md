The distribution functionality in the Azure Storage Uploader allows users to package and distribute the script for easy installation and usage.

## Purpose

The purpose of the distribution functionality is to simplify the deployment process by providing a packaged script that can be easily distributed and installed on different systems.

## Usage

To use the distribution functionality, follow these steps:

1. **Include the Distribution Script:**
   - Ensure that the `distribution_script.sh` script is sourced within your main script or included in your project.

     ```bash
     source distribution_script.sh
     ```

2. **Call the Package Script Function:**
   - Before initiating the distribution, call the `package_script` function to package the main script.

     ```bash
     package_script
     ```

3. **Distribute the Packaged Script:**
   - Distribute the packaged script, which is located in the `dist` directory, to users or systems.

4. **Installation Instructions:**
   - Provide users with clear instructions on how to install and use the packaged script.

## Example

Here is an example of how to integrate the distribution functionality into your script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Include the Distribution Script
source distribution_script.sh

# Call the Package Script function
package_script
```

## Notes

- The `package_script` function packages the main script into a distribution-ready format, placing it in the `dist` directory.

- Customize the distribution process based on your project's specific requirements and distribution preferences.

- Ensure that users have the necessary permissions to execute the packaged script.

- Provide clear installation instructions and any dependencies required for users to successfully use the script.

- Regularly update the packaged script to include the latest enhancements and bug fixes.

**Note:** Uncomment the example usage line in `distribution_script.sh` before running the script.
