# Issue Tracker

If you find any bugs, have feature requests, or encounter issues, we encourage you to report them using our GitHub Issue Tracker. Your feedback is valuable and helps us improve the Azure Storage Uploader.

## How to Report an Issue

1. **Check for Existing Issues:**
   Before creating a new issue, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/your-username/azure-storage-uploader/issues) to see if the problem or feature request has already been reported.

2. **Create a New Issue:**
   If you couldn't find an existing issue, [create a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/azure-storage-uploader/issues/new). Please provide detailed information to help us understand and address the problem or suggestion.

   - **Bug Report:**
     - Clearly describe the issue.
     - Provide steps to reproduce the bug.
     - Include any relevant error messages or screenshots.

   - **Feature Request:**
     - Clearly describe the new feature or enhancement you are proposing.
     - Explain why the feature is valuable and how it aligns with the project's goals.

3. **Labels:**
   When creating an issue, consider adding appropriate labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, or others to categorize and prioritize it.

4. **Discussion:**
   Feel free to participate in existing issue discussions. Your insights and experiences can contribute to resolving issues or refining feature requests.
